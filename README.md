# IMPACT US
I'm building an API REST for an e-commerce called by Impact Us. In this e-commerce you can have a common user and an adminstrator user. The common user can create a user,
look for products, add in a shipping cart and see your products. An Administrator can have an account, add products to clients buy, remove products and other things.
## üõ†Ô∏è Building with:
